# Mobile-App-Development-Week-5

This application introduces taking in a file in order to create multiple tables.
The file that was provided was a dictionary of categories that contained an array of objects.
The intent was to read through the file, get all the categories and create a table from which a user can select a category and the associated apps would be displayed in another table. The apps table would then lead the user to a screen where app details was presented.
